Scripts for generating various negative sets:

* 1. gc-balanced
* 2. Multi-tasked matrix
* 3. Universal negatives (needs to be copied from brahma) 
* 4. Sampled whole genome negatives
* 5. Tiled whole genome negatives

Examples of how to use these scripts on a dataset are in the "cholvars" folder

"seq_utils" folder contains tools for train/test/validation split generation, padding/trimming sequences, etc.
